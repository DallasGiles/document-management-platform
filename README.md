# ConstructComm

## Description

The purpose of this project was to find a way to make construction blueprints easier to view and edit for the entire team. An issue for many construction companies has been the lack of tools to help all members of the team be able to see the blueprints. Our application uses the AWS storage systems to store files that can be accessed by multiple users.

## Installation

You will need to run an npm install in the sever and client folders. It also requires an AWS S3 account for storage services.

## Usage
On page open you are met with a login page and the ability to login as regular user or a manager. You can click [this link](https://construct-comm.onrender.com) to access the deployed application. The application will require you to signup for an account or login through a previously registered account. From a user's homepage a form will allow the upload to the S3 bucket of this application. From this same page previously uploaded files can be viewed by accesssing a signed URL from AWS.
